Theories with a large number of degrees of freedom are best tested by statistical means.  Multi-axion theories (“the axiverse”) can be described by distribution functions for the mass,ma, decayconstant,fa, and initial misalignment angle, \theta_i, of each axion.  The CMB measurement of the darkmatter density,  and the agreement of the shape of the anistropy spectrum with the cosmologicalstandard model, constrain the existence of stable light, axions with large energy density.  We presentthe first constraints on multi-axion theories from thePlanckcosmic microwave background (CMB)anisotropies via the use of a simplified likelihood function in a quasi-Bayesian analysis.  A theorywithNaxaxions results fromNaxcorrelated draws from the (ma,fa,θi) prior distributions.  Thedistribution functions are described by hyperparameters, themselves subject to priors.  Hyper parameters leading to distributions with a high probability of one ore more axions lying in the excludedregion are disfavoured.  The results can be interpreted in terms of various random matrix models forthe axion kinetic and mass matrices, which generate the hyperparameters and distribution functions.
